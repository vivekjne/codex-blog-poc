The React Compiler aims to eliminate manual memoization by understanding component semantics. That means less `useMemo` fatigue and fewer accidental performance regressions.

## What changes for teams

- Components can stay simple without losing performance.
- You can spend more time on user-facing improvements instead of performance micromanagement.

## How to prepare

Focus on idiomatic React patterns. Avoid mutating state, rely on pure components, and keep side effects predictable.

## The new mental model

Performance becomes a tooling problem rather than a human burden. That’s a win, but it also means your linting and CI should enforce the patterns the compiler expects.

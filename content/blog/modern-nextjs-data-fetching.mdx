The App Router gives you a spectrum of data fetching behaviors. The key is to decide **what needs to be fresh** and **what can be cached**.

## Start with static when you can

Static data is free performance. Use `fetch` with `next: { revalidate }` for content that changes occasionally.

## Stream the dynamic parts

For personalized data, isolate it in server components or route handlers that can stream after the shell.

## Cache with intent

Treat caching as a product decision. If data changes hourly, cache it hourly. If it changes per user, don’t cache it globally.

## A typical split

- Global shell: static
- Content: revalidated
- Personalized blocks: dynamic

Build a matrix for each page and document the decision. Your future self will thank you.

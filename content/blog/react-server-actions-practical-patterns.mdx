React Server Actions unlock a new mental model: push logic closer to the server while keeping the client experience buttery smooth. The trick is to treat them as **one part** of a well-designed flow, not the whole flow.

## Start with the happy path

Use server actions for the core mutation. Pair that with optimistic UI so the interface feels instant even when latency spikes.

## Layer in progressive enhancement

Keep forms functional without JavaScript. Then, enhance them with inline loading states and field-level feedback.

## Move validation to the edges

Run validation in three places:

- On the client for instant feedback
- Inside the action for canonical validation
- In the data layer for invariants

## A reference architecture

I like pairing actions with a thin domain layer that owns validation, and a UI layer that owns user experience. This ensures the action remains composable and testable.

```tsx
'use server'

export async function updateProfile(input: ProfileInput) {
  const data = profileSchema.parse(input)
  return updateProfileRecord(data)
}
```

## What to watch next

Server Actions are evolving quickly. Watch for better streaming patterns and compiler-driven optimizations in the React ecosystem.

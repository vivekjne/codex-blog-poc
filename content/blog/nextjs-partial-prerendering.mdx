Partial prerendering gives you a new default: ship a fast shell, then stream in the expensive pieces. It’s ideal for dashboards, product catalogs, and any page with a stable frame plus dynamic data.

## Why it matters

- You avoid blocking the entire page on slow data.
- You keep the core layout stable for user perception.
- You can prioritize data that actually needs freshness.

## Practical use cases

Think of a pricing page with a static hero and a dynamically loaded comparison table, or a marketing site with live stats that update after the initial paint.

## Adopt it safely

Start by identifying slow sections and wrap them in streaming boundaries. Measure the impact with real user metrics, not just lab scores.

## The tradeoffs

Partial prerendering is powerful, but you’ll want to be explicit about which fragments can lag. Not everything should be streamed.
